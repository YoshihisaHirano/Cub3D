	Ray-casting is a 2.5D rendering techniques that was very popular in the 90s, seen in computer games and video games such as Wolfenstein 3D.
	<p>This first of a series of demos demonstrates:
	<li>Wall finding algorithm.  
	<li>Lookup table generations (sine, cosine, fisheye correction tables and more)
	<li>Distortion corrections. Ie: How to deal with fishbowl/fisheye effects (bent walls). 
	<li>Simple flat wall shading (rendering wall slices with simple solid colored lines). 
	<li>Rendering of simple (static) ground and sky (with gradients added for a bit of polish)
	<li>Movement handling using keyboard keys.
	<li>Overhead map to visualize where the rays are and where they hit the walls.

<p>	
	 To move around the demo, use the arrow keys on your keyboard or the W,A,S,D keys.
